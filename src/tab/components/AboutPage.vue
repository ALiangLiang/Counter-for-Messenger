    <h1>Note</h1>
    <p>
      It'a web extension you know. Inspired by the fact that I want to know
      how many messages I have with my best friends.
      In the beginning it was just a little project. Very simple and ugly.
      But recently, more and more users installed this extension,
      and encouraged me to develop it further. I don't want to disappoint them.
      So I've updated this project, Making it more powerful and beautiful.
      If you really like this extension, tell me. I would very happy.
      ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ Thanks everyone.
